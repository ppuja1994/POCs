	<div  class="bodyleft" >The most obvious function of clothing is to improve the comfort 
	of the wearer, by protecting the wearer from the elements. In hot climates, clothing
	 provides protection from sunburn or wind damage, while in cold climates its thermal 
	 insulation properties are generally more important. Shelter usually reduces the functional
	  need for clothing. For example, coats, hats, gloves, and other superficial layers are 
	  normally removed when entering a warm home, particularly if one is residing or sleeping there.
	   Similarly, clothing has seasonal and regional aspects, so that thinner materials and
	    fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer seasons and regions than in 
	    colder ones.
      In most cultures, gender differentiation of clothing is considered appropriate for men and women.
       The differences are in styles, colors and fabrics.
	In Western societies, skirts, dresses and high-heeled shoes are usually seen as women's clothing,
	 while neckties are usually seen as men's clothing. Trousers were once seen as exclusively
	  male clothing, but are nowadays worn by both genders. Male clothes are often more practical 
	  (that is, they can function well under a wide variety of situations), but a wider range of 
	  clothing styles are available for females. Males are typically allowed to bare their chests
	   in a greater variety of public places. It is generally acceptable for a woman to wear traditionally
	    male clothing, while the converse is unusual.
	Some human cultures, such as the various people of the Arctic Circle, traditionally make their clothing
	 entirely of prepared and decorated furs and skins. Other cultures supplemented or replaced leather
	  and skins with cloth: woven, knitted, or twined from various animal and vegetable fibers.
	  There exists a diverse range of styles in fashion, varying by geography, exposure to modern
	   media, economic conditions, and ranging from expensive haute couture to traditional garb, to thrift store grunge.</div>
